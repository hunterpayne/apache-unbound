# Installing the CLI

To use it, pull this repo and build it with ```mvn clean install```.  This
will build a Deb installed at target/unbound_1.0.0-1_all.deb and a RPM
installer at target/rpm/unbound/RPMS/noarch/unbound-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm
Install the appropiate one for your distribution of Linux.

For Windows the installer is generated at target/unbound-1.0.0.exe

For OSX use the RPM installer.  You might have to install rpm via brew.
