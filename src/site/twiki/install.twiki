---++ Installing the CLI

To use it, pull this repo and build it with _mvn clean install_

This will build:
   * A Debian installer at <a href="https://github.com/hunterpayne/maven-unbound-site/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta1/unbound-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm">target/unbound_1.0.0-1_all.deb</a>
   * A RPM installer at <a href="https://github.com/hunterpayne/maven-unbound-site/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta1/unbound-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm">target/rpm/unbound/RPMS/noarch/unbound-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm</a>

Install the appropiate one for your OS and/or distribution of Linux
